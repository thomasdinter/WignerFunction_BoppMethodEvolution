Code for modelling the time-evolution of an arbitrary initial Wigner function in an arbitrary potential landscape, as created by Thomas Dinter for his Master's of Research thesis (2024). 

This code utilises a split-spectral method and the four-operator _Bopp_ algebra, such that the equation of motion for the Wigner function reduces to a series of FFTs.
